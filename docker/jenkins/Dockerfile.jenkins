# NOTE:
# Jenkins should act purely as an orchestrator. Agents should handle builds, container interactions, and anything requiring Docker CLI.
# If a job needs to interact with Docker, it should be assigned to a Docker-enabled agent.
# Keeping Jenkins lean improves security and reduces the attack surface.
# Instead, run diagnostics and Docker commands inside the dind container when needed.
